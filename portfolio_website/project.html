                <h4>Data Extraction using Recursive AWS Lambda with CI/CD setup </h4>
                <p>Developed an innovative and cost-effective process to onboard data from any relational database to an AWS S3 bucket using the lambda function in a recursive fashion.
                    Flexibility to fetch data from sources like S3, dynamoDB, APIs, data warehouses, etc.

                <h4>Data Engineering using Apache Airflow </h4>
                <p>The project aimed to create a data pipeline that gathers data from different locations at a different frequency and then transforms the data and merges it into a single file.
                     The orchestration was done with the help of airflow, which was running on AWS EC2 and the data transformation was done with the help of Python using the pandas module.
